<p>
<h2>NAME</h2>ssh-cron - cron-like daemon able to use ssh-connections
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
       <strong>ssh-cron</strong> [OPTIONS] <em>[crontab-file]</em> <br/>
        [OPTIONS] - cf. section <strong>OPTIONS</strong><br/>
        [crontab-file] - file containing jobs to run.<br/>
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Consider the situation where a computer every now and then must access a
remote computer to do some useful things at that remote computer (like running
a <strong>stealth</strong>(1) file integrity scan). In order to do so the computer must be
allowed to make <strong>ssh</strong>(1) connections to the remote computer. But since the
commands are not executed by the user but by <strong>cron</strong>(1), the ssh-keys which
are required to access the remote computer cannot use passphrases.
<p>
This is an undesirable situation: if the computer running the <em>ssh</em> commands
gets compromised, then the remote computers are compromised as well, since the
attacker may access these remote systems using ssh keys not requiring pass
phrases.
<p>
<strong>Ssh-Cron</strong> offers a way out of this undesirable situation, while still allowing
commands to be executed on remote computers. Here's how this is realized:
<p>
<ul>
    <li> Normally, <strong>ssh-cron</strong> runs as a daemon program. When <strong>ssh-cron</strong> starts it first
        reads and parses a crontab-like specification file. Following this,
        <strong>ssh-cron</strong> spawns a child process, and terminates.
<p>
<li> <strong>Ssh-Cron</strong>'s daemon process itself spawns an <strong>ssh-agent</strong>(1) child
        process, executing all scheduled commands.
<p>
<li> In addition, <strong>ssh-cron</strong>'s daemon defines communcation channels between
       itself and its <strong>ssh-agent</strong>(1) child process;
<p>
<li> <strong>Ssh-Cron</strong>'s daemon sends the command <strong>ssh-add</strong>(1) to its child process as
       its first command to execute, and using normal user-interaction means
       (e.g., using <strong>ssh-askpass</strong>(1)) <em>ssh-agent</em> is provided with the
       required passphrase(s) for the ssh key(s).
<p>
<li> <strong>Ssh-Cron</strong>'s daemon now monitors the time, firing off scheduled commands at
       their required moments in time. If these commands require access to
       remote computers, then this access is granted, as <em>ssh-agent</em> is able
       to provide the passphrase(s).
<p>
<li> If an <strong>ssh-cron</strong> daemon process is already running, then the <em>--reload</em>
       option (see below), can be used to load the <strong>ssh-cron</strong> daemon with the
       commands and environment variable settings from another
       <em>crontab-file</em>, replacing the currently stored commands and
       environment settings by the ones provided in the reloaded file.
    </ul>
<p>
When shell control characters (like redirection symbols) must be used in
command specifications, they should be escaped. E.g., as in <em>echo hello
world \&gt; /dev/null</em>.
<p>
Users sharing a computer each define their own <strong>ssh-cron</strong> specification file. When a
user logs out and leaves the
system the daemon process continues to run, executing its scheduled commands
at their scheduled times, using ssh-keys whenever required.
<p>
If the accounts for which <strong>ssh-cron</strong> jobs are running are ever compromised,
the remote computers remain safe, as the passphrases of the available 
ssh-keys remain unavailable.
<p>
To prevent unauthorized modifications of the commands scheduled by the <strong>ssh-cron</strong>
daemon themselves a passphrase is required when starting <strong>ssh-cron</strong>'s daemon
process. The passphrase itself is not stored by the daemon (instead, it
stores a <strong>sha256</strong>(1) hash value), which avoids access to the <strong>ssh-cron</strong> daemon's
passphrase by browsing the computer's memory. The passphrase may be empty,
but even then that empty passphrase must be provided when reloading <strong>ssh-cron</strong>
daemon's scheduled commands. The scheduled commands may be listed,
however. This is allowed without providing a passphrase since the file
containing the scheduled commands will usually also be available on the
computer. Likewise, since a user may always terminate his/her own programs an
<strong>ssh-cron</strong> daemon process can be terminated from another <strong>ssh-cron</strong> program using the
<em>--terminate</em> command line option.
<p>
The above-mentioned facilities are not supported by <strong>crontab</strong>(1) itself.
<strong>Cron</strong>(1), which is responsible for executing scheduled crontab commands,
has no access to the passphrases of ssh-keys (which are otherwise provided
<em>ssh-agent</em>).
<p>
<h2>RETURN VALUE</h2>
<p>
<strong>Ssh-Cron</strong> returns 0 if the daemon was successfully started. Otherwise 1 is
returned. 
<p>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<p>
Where available, single letter options are listed between parentheses
following their associated long-option variants. Single letter options require
arguments if their associated long options also require arguments.
<p>
Several options have default values. Run <em>ssh-cron --help</em> for an overview
of the implemented default option values. Also, several options can be
specified in a configuration file (where this doesn't hold true, it is
explicitly mentioned at the relevant options).
<p>
The configuration file (not to be confused with the file containing the
scheduled commands, which is provided as <strong>ssh-cron</strong> command-line file argument)
ignores empty lines and all information on lines starting at a hash-mark
(<em>#</em>, optionally preceded by blanks and/or tabs). The configuration file is
used to specify <strong>ssh-cron</strong>'s options using their long variants. However, in the
configuration file the initial hyphens of command-line options must be
omitted, and optionally a colon may be appended to these long options
names. Note that multi-word option arguments should not be surrounded by
quotes. Examples:
            <pre>

    stdout
    syslog-facility: LOCAL0
    mailer: /usr/bin/mail -s "some subject" me@myhost.warpnet.nl
            
</pre>

    Command-line options always override configuration file options.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>--agent</strong>=<em>agent</em><br/>
       absolute path to the agent program (plus its argument(s)) providing the
        ssh-keys. 
<p>
By default <em>/usr/bin/ssh-agent /bin/bash</em> is used.
<p>
<li> <strong>--config</strong>=<em>path</em> (<strong>-c</strong>)<br/>
        config file containing long option specifications.
<p>
By default <em>~/.ssh-cron</em> is used.
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--forced</strong> (<strong>-f</strong>)<br/>
        When restarting <strong>ssh-cron</strong> and an existing (leftover) ipc-file file
        exists, then the user is interactively given the opportunity to remove
        the existing ipc-file during daemon-startup.
<p>
<li> <strong>--help</strong> (<strong>-h</strong>)<br/>
       basic usage information is written to the standard output
        stream (only interpreted in combination with <em>--no-daemon</em>).
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--ipc-file</strong>=<em>path</em> (<strong>-p</strong>)<br/>
       when <strong>ssh-cron</strong> runs as a daemon, then <em>path</em> specifies the path of the file
        holding the daemon's shared memory ID and process ID. The ipc file
        must be available if <strong>ssh-cron</strong> is connecting to or starting a daemon process
        (the former situation occurs with the options <em>--list, --reload</em>,
        and <em>--terminate</em>). If <strong>ssh-cron</strong> detects an existing <em>ipc-file</em> at
        daemon startup and the option <em>--forced</em> was not specified, then the
        user is interactively given the opportunity to remove the existing
        file. If the existing ipc-file can or should not be removed, then the
        daemon is not started. To end a daemon process use <em>ssh-cron
        --terminate</em>, or send a SIGINT (<em>ctrl-C</em>) or SIGTERM signal to the
        process-id found as the second value in the <em>ipc-file</em>.
<p>
By default <em>~/.ssh-cron.ipc</em> is used.
<p>
<li> <strong>--list</strong> (<strong>-l</strong>)<br/>
       list the currently defined environment settings and cron-commands (the
        <em>crontab-file</em> argument must be omitted). This option is
        incompatible with (--no-daemon, --reload,) and <em>--terminate</em>.
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--log</strong>=<em>path</em> (<strong>-L</strong>)<br/>
       log messages are appended to <em>path</em>. If <em>path</em> does not exist, it
        is created first.
<p>
<li> <strong>--mailer</strong>=<em>command</em> (<strong>-m</strong>)<br/>
       information written to the standard output or standard error streams of
        the commands executed by <strong>ssh-cron</strong> is sent by e-mail to the current
        user. Use <em>--mailer</em> to redefine (or to suppress sending e-mail by
        specifying an empty mailer command (i.e., <em>--mailer ""</em>)).
<p>
By default <em>/usr/bin/mail -s \"Ssh-cron $*\" $USER@localhost</em> is
        used, with <em>$*</em> replaced by the exected command as specified in the
        <em>crontab</em> file argument.
<p>
<li> <strong>--no-daemon</strong> <br/>
       <strong>ssh-cron</strong> is not run as a daemon. To properly end <strong>ssh-cron</strong> if not running as a
        daemon, press the `Enter' key, enter <em>ctrl-C</em> or send <strong>ssh-cron</strong> a
        <em>SIGTERM</em> signal. This option is incompatible with ( --list,
        --reload,) and <em>--terminate</em>.
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--reload</strong> (<strong>-r</strong>)<br/>
       reload the <strong>ssh-cron</strong> daemon with de cron-commands defined in the
        <em>crontab-file</em> argument (which must be provided). This option is
        incompatible with (--list, --no-daemon,) and <em>--terminate</em>.
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--stdout</strong> (<strong>-s</strong>)<br/> 
       in addition to using a log file and syslog messages send all messages
        to the standard output. This option is not available if <strong>ssh-cron</strong> runs as a
        daemon process.
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--syslog</strong><br/>
       messages are sent to the syslog daemon when this option is specified.
        By default syslog messages are written to the <em>DAEMON</em> facility with
        priority <em>NOTICE</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong>--syslog-facility</strong>=<em>facility</em><br/>
       the facility that is used to write the syslog messages to. By default
        this is <em>DAEMON</em>. For an overview of facilities and their meanings,
        see, e.g., <strong>syslog</strong>(3). With <strong>ssh-cron</strong> the facilities <em>DAEMON,
        LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7</em>, and
        <em>USER</em> can be used.
<p>
By default facility <em>DAEMON</em> is used.
<p>
<li> <strong>--syslog-priority</strong>=<em>priority</em><br/>
       the priority that is used to write the syslog messages to. By default
        this is <em>NOTICE</em>. For an overview of priorities and their meanings,
        see, e.g., <strong>syslog</strong>(3). With <strong>ssh-cron</strong> all defined priorities can
        be used. E.g., <em> EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO</em> and
        <em>DEBUG</em>.
<p>
By default priority <em>NOTICE</em> is used.
<p>
<li> <strong>--syslog-tag</strong>=<em>tag</em><br/>
       syslog messages can be provided with a <em>tag</em>, which can be used to
        filter them from the log-files. See also section <em>RSYSLOG
        FILTERING</em> below.
<p>
By default the tag <em>SSH-CRON</em> is used.  
<p>
<li> <strong>--terminate</strong> (<strong>-t</strong>)<br/>
       terminate a running <strong>ssh-cron</strong> daemon program, using the daemon's process ID
        found in the ipc-file's second value. The <em>crontab-file</em> argument
        must be omitted. This option is incompatible tt with (--list,
        --nodaemon,) and <em>--reload</em>
.
        This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong>--verbose</strong><br/> 
       additional messages about <strong>ssh-cron</strong>'s mode of operation are sent to
        <strong>ssh-cron</strong>'s log facilities (specified by <em>--log, --syslog,</em> and/or
        <em>--stdout</em>). 
<p>
<li> <strong>--version</strong> (<strong>-v</strong>)<br/>
       <strong>ssh-cron</strong>'s version number is written to the standard output stream.
<p>
This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
</ul> 
<p>
<h2>RSYSLOG FILTERING</h2>
<p>
When using <strong>rsyslogd</strong>(1) property based filters may be used to filter
syslog messages and write them to a file of your choice. E.g., to filter
messages starting with the syslog message tag (e.g., <em>SSH-CRON</em>) use
        <pre>

:syslogtag, isequal, "SSH-CRON:"   /var/log/ssh-cron.log
:syslogtag, isequal, "SSH-CRON:"   stop
        
</pre>

    Note that the colon is part of the tag, but is not specified with the 
<em>syslog-tag</em> option.
<p>
This causes all messages having the <em>SSH-CRON:</em> tag to be written on
<em>/var/log/ssh-cron.log</em> after which they are discarded. More extensive
filtering is also supported, see, e.g.,
<em>http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/rsyslog_conf_filter.html</em> and
<em>http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/property_replacer.html</em>
