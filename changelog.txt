ssh-cron (1.01.00)

  * The user is interactively given an opportunity to remove an existing
    (left-over) ipc file when (re)starting ssh-cron.

  * Added option --forced (or: -f) to force the removal of an already existing
    ipc-file during daemon startup.

  * Build scripts adapted to icmake 8.00.04.

ssh-cron (1.00.01)

  * Kevin Brodsky observed that the installation scripts used 'chdir' rather
    than 'cd'. Fixed in this release.

  * Kevin Brodsky also observed that the combined size of all precompiled 
    headers might exceed some disks capacities. The option -P was added to the
    ./build script to prevent the use of precompiled headers.

ssh-cron (1.00.00)

 * Update to version 1.00.00 after being operational for one year without
   issues. 

 * Added 'INSTALL' and 'required'

 * Standardized the (de)installation procedures

ssh-cron (0.92.00)

 * cron/call checked the need to activate a program by either looking for a
   matching month daynr, OR by looking for a matching day-of-week number. This
   is wrong: a spec. like * * * * 4 should only run on Wednesdays. The check
   now requires all time specifications to match the current time.

ssh-cron (0.91.03)

  * Michael Tautschnig reported a FTBFS error, probably due to a missing
    -lpthread flag. Now added.

ssh-cron (0.91.02)

  * No idea what required this subminor version, but according to Debian's
    changelog we're at 0.91.02....

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 26 Aug 2014 09:11:41 +0200

ssh-cron (0.91.01)

  * Changed 'pass phrase' into 'passphrase' following Tony Mancill's advice

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 14 Jun 2014 22:31:08 +0200

ssh-cron (0.91.00)

  * A passphrase is required when starting the ssh-cron daemon or when
    modifiying the daemon's scheduled commands.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 09 Jun 2014 13:45:06 +0200

ssh-cron (0.90.00)

  * Commands using an ssh-key requiring a passphrase have been successfully
    executed when scheduled. When running ssh-cron as a daemon scheduling
    continued after the user starting the daemon had logged out.

  * Be advised: to run (or compile) ssh-cron, bobcat >= 3.23.00 is required.

  * SSH-cron's development status is now BETA.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 07 Jun 2014 16:39:32 +0200

ssh-cron (0.80.00)

  * SSH-cron's development status is now ALPHA: daemon,--no-daemon, --list,
    --reload, and --terminate have been shown to work as planned. 

  * Be advised that compiling and running ssh-cron requires at least Bobcat
    3.23.00, which is currently only available from Bobcat's git repo:
        commit 9eb8bc8029a4472d12a92a350b302ae2f71f496e
